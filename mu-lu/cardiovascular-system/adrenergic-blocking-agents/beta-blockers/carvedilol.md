| 附帶說明 | Only one report describing the use of carvedilol in human pregnancy has been located. The animal data and the experience with other, similar agents suggest that the risk of teratogenicity is low. Intrauterine growth restriction \(IUGR\), however, has been reported in the case below and is known to occur with other α/β-blockers \(see Labetalol\). Moreover, some β-blockers have caused IUGR and reduced placental weight, especially those lacking intrinsic sympathomimetic activity \(ISA\) \(i.e., partial agonist\). Treatment beginning early in the 2nd trimester results in the greatest weight reductions, whereas treatment restricted to the 3rd trimester primarily affects only placental weight. Carvedilol does not possess ISA. IUGR and reduced placental weight may potentially occur with all agents within this class. Although growth restriction is a serious concern, the benefits of maternal therapy with carvedilol \(or other α/β-blockers\), in some cases, might outweigh the risks to the fetus and must be judged on a case-by-case basis. |
| 哺乳期用藥建議 | No \(Limited\) Human Data - Probably Compatible 無\(很少\)資料 - 可使用 |
| 附帶說明 | No reports describing the use of carvedilol during human lactation have been located. The molecular weight \(about 407\) and long terminal elimination half-life \(7–10 hours\) suggest that the drug will be excreted into breast milk, but the high plasma protein binding \(&gt;98%\) should limit the amount. The potential effects of this exposure on a nursing infant include bradycardia, hypotension, and other symptoms of α/β-blockade. However, in 2001, a similar agent was classified by the American Academy of Pediatrics as compatible with breastfeeding. |
