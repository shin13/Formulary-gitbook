## DEFINITIONS OF PREGNANCY RECOMMENDATIONS

**COMPATIBLE**
The human pregnancy experience, either for the drug itself or drugs in the same class or with similar mechanisms of action, is adequate to demonstrate that the embryo–fetal risk is very low or nonexistent. Animal reproduction data are not relevant.

**NO (LIMITED) HUMAN DATA—PROBABLY COMPATIBLE**
There may or may not be human pregnancy experience, but the characteristics of the drug suggest that it does not represent a significant risk to the embryo–fetus. For example, other drugs in the same class or with similar mechanisms are compatible or the drug does not obtain significant systemic concentrations. Any animal reproduction data are not relevant.

**COMPATIBLE—MATERNAL BENEFIT >> EMBRYO–FETAL RISK**
There may or may not be human pregnancy experience, but the potential maternal benefit far outweighs the known or unknown embryo–fetal risk. Animal reproduction data are not relevant.

**HUMAN DATA SUGGEST LOW RISK**
There is limited human pregnancy experience, either for the drug itself or drugs in the same class or with similar mechanisms of action, including the 1st trimester, suggesting that the drug does not represent a significant risk of developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavioral deficits, or death) at any time in pregnancy. The limited human pregnancy data outweigh any animal reproduction data.

**NO (LIMITED) HUMAN DATA—ANIMAL DATA SUGGEST LOW RISK**
Either there is no human pregnancy experience or the few pregnancy exposures have not been associated with developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavioral deficits, or death). The drug does not cause developmental toxicity (at doses that did not cause maternal toxicity) in all animal species studied at doses ≤10 times the human dose based on body surface area (BSA) or AUC*.

**NO (LIMITED) HUMAN DATA—ANIMAL DATA SUGGEST MODERATE RISK**
Either there is no human pregnancy experience or the few pregnancy exposures have not been associated with developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavioral deficits, or death). The drug causes developmental toxicity (at doses that did not cause maternal toxicity) in one animal species at doses ≤10 times the human dose based on body surface area (BSA) or AUC*.

**NO (LIMITED) HUMAN DATA—ANIMAL DATA SUGGEST RISK**
Either there is no human pregnancy experience or the few pregnancy exposures have not been associated with developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavioral deficits, or death). The drug causes developmental toxicity (at doses that did not cause maternal toxicity) in two animal species at doses ≤10 times the human dose based on body surface area (BSA) or AUC*.

**NO (LIMITED) HUMAN DATA—ANIMAL DATA SUGGEST HIGH RISK**
Either there is no human pregnancy experience or the few pregnancy exposures have not been associated with developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavioral deficits, or death). The drug causes developmental toxicity (at doses that did not cause maternal toxicity) in three or more animal species at doses ≤10 times the human dose based on body surface area (BSA) or AUC.

__*AUC = area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve; a measure of the systemic exposure of a drug__

**CONTRAINDICATED—1ST TRIMESTER**
Human exposures in the 1st trimester, either to the drug itself or to drugs in the same class or with similar mechanisms of action, have been associated with developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavioral deficits, or death). The drug should not be used in the 1st trimester.

**CONTRAINDICATED—2ND AND 3RD TRIMESTERS**
Human exposures in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, either to the drug itself or to drugs in the same class or with similar mechanisms of action, have been associated with developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavior deficits, or death). The drug should not be used in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters.

**CONTRAINDICATED**
Human exposures at any time in pregnancy, either to the drug itself or to drugs in the same class or with similar mechanisms of action, have been associated with developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavioral deficits, or death). Animal reproduction data, if available, confirm the risk. The drug should not be used in pregnancy.

**NO (LIMITED) HUMAN DATA—NO RELEVANT ANIMAL DATA**
There are no human pregnancy data or relevant data in animals, or the human pregnancy experience, that may or may not include the 1st trimester, is limited. The risk in pregnancy cannot be assessed.

**HUMAN DATA SUGGEST RISK IN 1ST TRIMESTER**
Evidence (for the drug or similar drugs) suggests that there may be an embryo–fetal risk for developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavioral deficits, or death) in the 1st trimester but not in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. The human pregnancy data outweigh any animal reproduction data.

**HUMAN DATA SUGGEST RISK IN 1ST AND 3RD TRIMESTERS**
Evidence (for the drug or similar drugs) suggests that there may be an embryo–fetal risk for developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavioral deficits, or death) in the 1st and 3rd trimesters but not in the 2nd trimester. The human pregnancy data outweigh any animal reproduction data.

**HUMAN DATA SUGGEST RISK IN 2ND AND 3RD TRIMESTERS**
Evidence (for the drug or similar drugs) suggests that there may be a fetal risk for developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavioral deficits, or death) in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters but not in the 1st trimester. The human pregnancy data outweigh any animal reproduction data.

**HUMAN DATA SUGGEST RISK IN 3RD TRIMESTER**
Evidence (for the drug or similar drugs) suggests that there may be a fetal risk for developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavioral deficits, or death) in the 3rd trimester or close to delivery but not in the 1st or 2nd trimesters. The human pregnancy data outweigh any animal reproduction data.

**HUMAN (AND ANIMAL) DATA SUGGEST RISK**
The human data for the drug or drugs in the same class or with the same mechanism of action, and animal reproduction data if available, suggest that there may be a risk for developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/behavioral deficits, or death) throughout pregnancy. Usually, pregnancy exposure should be avoided, but the risk may be acceptable if the maternal condition requires the drug.



## DEFINITIONS OF BREASTFEEDING RECOMMENDATIONS

**COMPATIBLE**
Either the drug is not excreted in clinically significant amounts into human breast milk or its use during lactation does not, or is not expected to, cause toxicity in a nursing infant.

**HOLD BREASTFEEDING**
The drug may or may not be excreted into human breast milk, but the maternal benefit of therapy far outweighs the benefits of breast milk to an infant. Breastfeeding should be held until maternal therapy is completed and the drug has been eliminated (or reaches a low concentration) from her system.

**NO (LIMITED) HUMAN DATA—PROBABLY COMPATIBLE**
Either there are no human data or the human data are limited. The available data suggest that the drug does not represent a significant risk to a nursing infant.

**NO (LIMITED) HUMAN DATA—POTENTIAL TOXICITY**
Either there are no human data or the human data are limited. The characteristics of the drug suggest that it could represent a clinically significant risk to a nursing infant. Breastfeeding is not recommended.

**HUMAN DATA SUGGEST POTENTIAL TOXICITY**
Human data suggest a risk to a nursing infant. The drug is best avoided during breastfeeding. Depending on the drug, short-term use by the mother may be possible, but the infant should be closely monitored for potential adverse effects.

**NO (LIMITED) HUMAN DATA—POTENTIAL TOXICITY (MOTHER)**
Either there are no human data or the human data are limited. The characteristics of the drug suggest that breastfeeding could represent a clinically significant risk to the mother such as further loss of essential vitamins or nutrients. Breastfeeding is not recommended.

**CONTRAINDICATED**
There may or may not be human experience, but the combined data suggest that the drug may cause severe toxicity in a nursing infant, or breastfeeding is contraindicated because of the maternal condition for which the drug is indicated. Women should not breastfeed if they are taking the drug or have the condition.
