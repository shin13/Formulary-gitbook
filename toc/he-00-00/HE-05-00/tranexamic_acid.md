Acute myeloid leukemia - Hemorrhage
A continuous intravenous infusion of tranexamic acid (2000 milligrams in 500 milliliters of Dextrose 5% in water, given every 8 hours for 6 days) was reported effective in reducing hemorrhagic episodes and transfusion requirements in 12 patients with ACUTE PROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA in a small, double-blind study. The drug was initiated at the same time as the start of antileukemic therapy and there were no thromboembolic complications.
