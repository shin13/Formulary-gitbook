| 附帶說明 | Therefore, pregnant women who require an inhaled corticosteroid, such as budesonide, for control of their asthma should be counseled as to the risks and benefits of therapy, but treatment should not be withheld because of their pregnancy. Because of the availability of extensive human pregnancy experience, either albuterol or salmeterol would be a better choice if a pregnant woman required an inhaled β-adrenergic bronchodilator. |
