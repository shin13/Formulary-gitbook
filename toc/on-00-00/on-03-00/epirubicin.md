## Epicin 10mg/5mL

| 藥物代碼 | IEP10 |
| :--- | :--- |
| 適應症 | Leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, sarcomas, small-cell lung carcinoma, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer. Liver cancer, head & neck cancer, pancreatic cancer. |
| 副作用 | Myelosuppression, cardiotoxicity, alopecia, mucositis, GI disturbances, hyperpyrexia. |
| 禁忌 | Myelosuppression. Cardiac impairment. Previous full cumulative doses of anthracyclines. Pregnancy. Lactation. |
| 藥物保存方式 | 2-8 C |
| 用法用量 | Adult 75-90 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks When used as a single agent, the recommended dosage in adults is 60-90 mg/m2 body area; Epirubicin should be injected IV over 3-5 min and, depending on the patient's haematomedullar status, the dose should be repeated at 21-day intervals. Lower doses \(60-75 mg/m2\) are recommended for patients whose bone marrow function has already been impaired by previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy, by age or neoplastic bone marrow infiltration. The total dose per cycle may be divided over 2-3 successive days. When the drug is used in combination with other antitumour agents, the doses need to be adequately reduced. Since the major route of elimination is the hepatobiliary system, the dosage should be reduced in patients with impaired liver function, in order to avoid an increase of overall toxicity. Moderate liver impairment \(bilirubin: 1.4-3 mg/100 mL or BSP retention: 9-15%\) requires a 50% reduction of dose while severe impairment \(bilirubin &gt;3 mg/100 mL or BSP retention &gt;15%\) necessitates a dose reduction of 75%. Moderate renal impairment does not appear to require a dose reduction in view of the limited amount of Epirubicin excreted by this route. Administration: Epirubicin should be administered by IV injection. It is not active when given orally and should not be injected IM or intrathecally. It is advisable to give the drug via the tubing of a freely-running IV saline infusion after checking that the needle is well placed in the vein. This method minimizes the risk of drug extravasation and makes sure the vein is flushed with saline after the administration of the drug. Extravasation of Epirubicin from the vein during injection may give rise to severe tissue lesions, even necrosis. Venous sclerosis may result from injection into small vessels or repeated injections into the same vein. |
