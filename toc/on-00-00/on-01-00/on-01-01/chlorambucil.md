| Indications        | Management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Dosing             | Take daily on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before meals or 3 hours after meals). May be used in the management of Hodgkin's disease and non- Hodgkin's lymphomas in children. The dosage regimens are similar to those used in adults.  [Hodgkin's disease] 0.2 mg/kg/day for 4-8 weeks as a single agent in the palliative treatment of advanced disease[Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma] 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day as a single agent for 4-8 weeks initially; maintenance therapy is then given either by a reduced daily dosage or intermittent courses of treatment.  [Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia] 0.15 mg/kg/day initially until the total leukocyte count has fallen to 10,000/mL. Treatment may be resumed 4 weeks after the end of the first course and continued at a dosage of 0.1 mg/kg/day. [Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaema] Starting doses of 6-12 mg daily until leucopenia occurs are recommended followed by 2-8 mg daily indefinitely. |
