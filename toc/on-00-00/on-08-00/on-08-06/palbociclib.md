| Dosing             | The recommended dose of IBRANCE is a 125 mg capsule taken orally once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment to comprise a complete cycle of 28 days.When given with IBRANCE, the recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg administered on Days 1, 15, 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the full prescribing information of fulvestrant. Pre/perimenopausal women treated with the combination IBRANCE plus fulvestrant therapy should also be treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists according to current clinical practice standards. Recommended Dose Modification for Adverse Reactions: (Dose Level; Dose) Recommended starting dose: 125 mg/day; First dose reduction: 100 mg/day; Second dose reduction: 75 mg/day. Dose Modification and Management – Hematologic Toxicities: Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of IBRANCE therapy and at the beginning of each cycle, as well as on Day 15 of the first 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated. For patients who experience a maximum of Grade 1 or 2 neutropenia in the first 6 cycles, monitor complete blood counts for subsequent cycles every 3 months, prior to the beginning of a cycle and as clinically indicated. (CTCAE Grade) Grade 1 or 2: No dose adjustment is required. Grade 3: Day 1 of cycle: Withhold IBRANCE, repeat complete blood count monitoring within 1 week. When recovered to Grade 2, start the next cycle at the same dose. Day 15 of first 2 cycles: If Grade 3 on Day 15, continue IBRANCE at current dose to complete cycle and repeat complete blood count on Day 22. If Grade 4 on Day 22, see Grade 4 dose modification guidelines below. Consider dose reduction in cases of prolonged (>1 week) recovery from Grade 3 neutropenia or recurrent Grade 3 neutropenia on Day 1 of subsequent cycles. Grade 3 neutropeniab with fever more than 38.5 oC and/or infection: At any time: Withhold IBRANCE until recovery to Grade 2. Resume at the next lower dose.
