| Indications        | Second-line treatment for hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Second-line treatment of adult patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis, with serum phosphate concentrations ?5.5 mg/dl (1.78 mmol/L) and who have not been adequately controlled by diet alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Dosing             | The daily dose in divided doses with meals or immediately after meals. Control of serum phosphate level has been demonstrated at doses starting from 750 mg per day. Then titrate at intervals of 2 to 3 weeks until an acceptable serum phosphate level is reached. The recommended maximum dosage: 3750mg/day. [Micromedex 20210731] Initial dosage: 1500 mg per day, then titrate in increments of 750 mg/day at intervals of 2 to 3 weeks until an acceptable serum phosphate level is reached. Maintenance dosage: 1500 to 3000 mg per day is usually required to achieve plasma phosphate levels less than 6 mg/dL. Maximum dosage: 4500 mg/day was evaluated in ESRD patients. |
