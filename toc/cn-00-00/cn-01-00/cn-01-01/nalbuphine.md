*用法用量*：

The usual recommended adult dose is 10 mg for a 70 kg individual administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously; this dose may be repeated every 3 to 6 hours as necessary. Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the pain, the physical status of the patient, and other medications which the patient may be receiving. In nontolerant individuals, the recommended the single maximum dose is 20 mg, and the maximum total daily dose is 160 mg.
The use of Mutonpain as a supplement to balanced anesthesia requires larger doses than those recommended for analgesia. Induction doses of nalbuphine hydrochloride range from 0.3 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg intravenously to be administered over a 10 to 15 minute period with maintenance doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg in single intravenous administrations as required. The use of Mutonpain may be followed by respiratory depression which can be reversed with the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride.
