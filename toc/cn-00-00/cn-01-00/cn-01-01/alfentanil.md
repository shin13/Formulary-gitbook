Use as an Induction Agent: An intravenous bolus dose of > or =120 micrograms/kg (17mL/70kg) RAPIFEN will induce hypnosis and analgesia while maintaining good cardiovascular stability in patients with adequate muscle relaxation.
For short procedures, an initial dose 7-15 micrograms/kg at induction, with intermittent boluses up to 15 micrograms/kg (7-15 micrograms/kg) at 10-15 minute intervals are most useful. If the dose is less than 7micrograms/kg and IV injection slowly, most patients can still maintain normal respiratory function. the recommended additional dose is 3.5micrograms/kg.
For procedures of longer duration, a higher dose may be given at induction and further increments titrated to effect.
Duration of the procedure(min):10-30; Rapifen IV bolus dose: 20-40 Micrograms/kg ; 3-6mL/70kg;
Duration of the procedure(min):30-60; Rapifen IV bolus dose: 40-80 Micrograms/kg ; 6-12mL/70kg;
Duration of the procedure(min):>60; Rapifen IV bolus dose: 80-150 Micrograms/kg ; 12-20mL/70kg;
When surgery is more prolonged or more traumatic, analgesia should be maintained by:
‧ either increments of up to 15 micrograms/kg (2mL/70kg) RAPIFEN when required (to avoid
post-operative respiratory depression, no RAPIFEN should be administered during the last 10 minutes of surgery);
‧ or a RAPIFEN infusion at a rate of 0.5 to 1 microgram/kg/min (0.14mL/70kg/min) until 5 to 10 minutes before the completion of surgery.
Continuous infusion is preferable for cases greater than 60 minutes duration.
Rapifen should not be given in the last 10 minutes prior to completion of surgery.
