*用法用量*：

Entacapone is used in combination with levodopa preparations, either levodopa/carbidopa or levodopa/benserazide. Other antiparkinsonian drugs may be used simultaneously. One tablet is taken with each levodopa/dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor dose. Entacapone can be used with both standard and sustained-release preparations of levodopa. The starting dose of entacapone is the same as the maintenance dose.
On average, 4-7 doses daily are used in moderately or severely affected parkinsonian patients. The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg 10 times daily ie, 2 g of entacapone. The same dosage is used in all adults, including elderly patients.
In single-dose studies, the bioavailability of entacapone was increased in patients with moderate to severe liver insufficiency and the dosing interval should therefore be extended in these patients. Renal insufficiency does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone and there is no need for dose adjustment. However, patients who are receiving dialysis therapy should be closely monitored.
Entacapone enhances the effects of levodopa. Hence, to reduce levodopa-related dopaminergic adverse effects eg, dyskinesias, nausea, vomiting and hallucinations, it is often necessary to adjust levodopa dosage within the first few days to first few weeks after initiating treatment with entacapone. The daily dose of levodopa should be reduced by about 10-30% by extending the dosing intervals and/or by reducing the amount of levodopa per dose. If entacapone treatment is discontinued, it is necessary to adjust the dosage of other antiparkinsonian treatments, especially levodopa, to achieve a sufficient level of control of the parkinsonian symptoms.
Administration: Entacapone can be taken with or without food.
