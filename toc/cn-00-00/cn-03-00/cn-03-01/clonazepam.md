| Dosing             | The daily dose has to be slowly increased to a suitable maintenance dose for each patient to avoid the adverse effects of initial treatment. The daily dose can be given in a single dose at night if the target dose is reached. The maximum dose should be given at night if the daily dose must be divided several times. For adults: The maintenance dose is 2-4mg/day. The maximum dose is 20 mg/day. For infants and children under 10 years old (or weighing less than 30 Kg): The initial dose is 0.01- 0.03 mg/Kg/day. The maintenance dose is 0.05-0.1mg/Kg/day. For children over 10 years old (or weighing more than 30 Kg): The initial dose is 1-2 mg/day. The maintenance dose is 1.5-3mg/day. |
