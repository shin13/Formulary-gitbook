Initial Treatment:
Major Depressive Disorder - should be administered at a total dose of 40 mg/day (given as 20 mg BID) to 60 mg/day (given either once a day or as 30 mg BID) without regard to meals.
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain - should be administered at a total dose of 60 mg/day given once a day, without regard to meals.

Maintenance/Continuation/Extended Treatment
Major Depressive Disorder - It is generally agreed that acute episodes of major depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. There is insufficient evidence available to answer the question of how long a patient should continue to be treated with Cymbalta. Patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for maintenance treatment and the appropriate dose for such treatment. 
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain  - As the progression of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is highly variable and management of pain is empirical, the effectiveness of Cymbalta must be assessed individually. Efficacy beyond 12 weeks has not been systematically studied in placebo-controlled trials, but a one-year open-label safety study was conducted.
