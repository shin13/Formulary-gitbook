| Indications        | Heart failure: Reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure in patients with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction ?35%, who are in sinus rhythm with resting heart rate ?70 beats per minute (bpm) and either are on maximally tolerated doses of beta blockers or have a contraindication to beta-blocker use.          |
| Dosing             | Initial, 5 mg orally twice daily with food; after 2 weeks, adjust based on heart rate; for resting rate greater than 60 beats per minute (bpm), increase dose by 2.5 mg twice daily; for 50 to 60 bpm, continue current dose; for less than 50 bpm or for signs or symptoms of bradycardia, decrease dose by 2.5 mg twice daily; Maximum dose: 7.5 mg twice daily.                      |
