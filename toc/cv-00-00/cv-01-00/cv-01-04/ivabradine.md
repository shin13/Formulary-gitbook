| Dosing             | Initial, 5 mg orally twice daily with food; after 2 weeks, adjust based on heart rate; for resting rate greater than 60 beats per minute (bpm), increase dose by 2.5 mg twice daily; for 50 to 60 bpm, continue current dose; for less than 50 bpm or for signs or symptoms of bradycardia, decrease dose by 2.5 mg twice daily; Maximum dose: 7.5 mg twice daily.                                                |
