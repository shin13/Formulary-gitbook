| 附帶說明 | 無資料，比照 Chlorothiazide，如下： The published experience with 1st trimester use of thiazides and related diuretics does not indicate these agents are teratogenic. One large study \(the Collaborative Perinatal Project\) did find an increased risk of defects when diuretics were used during the 1st trimester in women with cardiovascular disorders, but causal relationships cannot be inferred from these data without independent confirmation. Diuretics are not recommended for the treatment of gestational hypertension or preeclampsia because of the maternal hypovolemia characteristic of this disease. Other risks to the fetus or newborn include hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and death from maternal complications. Moreover, thiazide diuretics may have a direct effect on smooth muscle and inhibit labor. |
| 哺乳期用藥建議 | Compatible 哺乳時可使用 |
| 附帶說明 | 比照 Chlorothiazide。 Chlorothiazide is excreted into breast milk in low concentrations. Thiazide diuretics have been used to suppress lactation. However, in 2001 the American Academy of Pediatrics classified bendroflumethiazide, chlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and hydrochlorothiazide as compatible with breastfeeding. |
