| 附帶說明 | No reports describing the use of alirocumab in human pregnancy have been located. Animal data suggest low risk, but the absence of human pregnancy data prevents a better assessment of the embryo–fetal risk. Based on studies in monkeys, exposure of the fetus late in pregnancy should be expected \(see below\). In addition, the drug is given to patients under treatment with statins. Statins are classified as contraindicated in pregnancy because interruption of cholesterol-lowering therapy during pregnancy should have no effect on the long-term treatment of hyperlipidemia and because of the human data reported with lovastatin \(see Lovastatin\). Consequently, alirocumab should also be classified contraindicated. |
