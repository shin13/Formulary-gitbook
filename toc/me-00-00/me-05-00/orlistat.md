| Indications        | Management of obesity, including weight loss and weight maintenance, in conjunction with a reduced-calorie diet; also indicated to reduce the risk for weight regain after prior weight loss. For adults: Suitable for the treatment of obesity in conjunction with a low-calorie diet, including patients with obesity-related risk factors. For adolescents: Orlistat treatment is only considered when other treatment approaches, including balanced diet suitable for the patient's age and a behavior-correcting exercise plan, have failed for a period of six months or more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Dosing             | Adults: Take 120 mg orally 3 times a day with each main meal containing fat (during or up to 1 hour after the meal). Skip if the meal is fat-free or skipped. Maintain a balanced, low-calorie diet with around 30% of daily calories from fat, distributed evenly among the 3 main meals. Adolescents (12 years or older): 120 mg orally 3 times a day with each main meal containing fat (during or up to 1 hour after the meal). Consume a nutritionally balanced diet with approximately 30% of calories from fat. Due to a lack of long-term treatment experience, the duration of treatment for adolescents should be limited to 1 year. Advise patients to take a daily multivitamin supplement providing fat-soluble vitamins and beta-carotene. The supplement should be taken at least 2 hours before or after orlistat. |
