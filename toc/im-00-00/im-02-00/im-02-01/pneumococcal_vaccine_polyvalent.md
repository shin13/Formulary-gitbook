| Indications        | For infants and children aged 2 months to 17 years, as well as adolescents, this vaccine is indicated for active immunization to prevent invasive diseases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F. Pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine can also be used to prevent otitis media caused by serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F in infants and toddlers under 2 years of age. Additionally, this vaccine is indicated for active immunization in adults and the elderly aged 18 and above to prevent invasive diseases and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Dosing             | Infants (2 to 6 months): Administer 3 doses of PCV13, 0.5 mL each, with at least a 1-month interval. First dose can be given as early as 6 weeks after birth, and a fourth dose is recommended at 12-15 months. Preterm Infants (<37 weeks gestation): Administer 3 doses of PCV13, 0.5 mL each, with at least a 1-month interval, starting at 2 months of age. The first dose can be given as early as 6 weeks. Consider a fourth dose between 11-15 months. Infants and Toddlers (7 months to 5 years) not previously vaccinated: (1) Infants (7-11 months): Administer 2 doses of PCV13, 0.5 mL each, with at least a 1-month interval. Recommend a third dose at 1 year of age. (2) Toddlers (12-23 months): Administer 2 doses, 0.5 mL each, with at least a 2-month interval. (3) Children (2-5 years): Administer a single dose of 0.5 mL. Children and Adolescents (6-17 years): Administer a single dose of 0.5 mL. Adults and Elderly (18 years and above): Administer a single dose of 0.5 mL. The need for subsequent doses of PCV13 is not established.
