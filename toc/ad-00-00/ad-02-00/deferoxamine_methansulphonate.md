| Dosing             | If the patient is normotensive, Desferal is usually given in a single IM dose: 2 g for an adult and 1 g for a child. If the patient is hypotensive, the IV route is recommended. The maximum rate for administration IV is 15 mg/kg/hr and is reduced after 4-6 hrs so that the total IV dose in general does not exceed 80 mg/kg/24 hrs. In an adult patient with severe iron poisoning even infusion of 37.1 g Desferal over 52 hrs has been tolerated without apparent unwanted effects. Therapy should be continued until the serum iron levels are less than the total iron-binding capacity. |
