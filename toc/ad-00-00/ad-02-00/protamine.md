## Protamine sulphate 50mg-5mL

*藥物代碼*：IPROA

*給藥途徑*：I

*用法用量*：

The effect of heparin can be reversed immediately by IV administration of a 1% protamine sulfate solution. 
The injection should be given very slowly (in 1-3 min). 
The quantity of protamine required for neutralization falls rapidly with the lapse of time after the administration of heparin. 
If given within 15 min of the heparin injection, 10 mg of protamine will neutralize 1000 iu of heparin, while 30 min after the heparin injection of 1000 iu, only 5 mg of protamine sulfate is needed. 
If more time has elapsed after the administration of heparin, the dose of protamine sulfate required for neutralization should be determined accurately by titrating with the patient's plasma.
