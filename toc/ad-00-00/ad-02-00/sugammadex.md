*用法用量*：

Routine reversal of rocuronium- or vecuronium-induced blockade: IV:
Deep block (at least 1 to 2 post-tetanic counts but prior to appearance of T2): 4 mg/kg as a single dose
Moderate block (after appearance of T2): 2 mg/kg as a single dose
Readministration of rocuronium or vecuronium: Following sugammadex use for routine reversal, waiting times for readministration of rocuronium or vecuronium vary greatly (5 minutes to 24 hours) depending on agent, dose, and renal function; if immediate neuromuscular blockade is needed, a nonsteroidal neuromuscular-blocking agent may be required.

Immediate reversal of rocuronium-induced blockade: IV: 16 mg/kg as a single dose administered soon (~3 minutes) after administration of a single dose of rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg. Note: This dose of sugammadex has not been evaluated following administration of vecuronium.
