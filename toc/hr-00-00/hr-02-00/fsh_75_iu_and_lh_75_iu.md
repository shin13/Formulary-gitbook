| Indications        | Promote ovulation in women who are not ovulating and who have not responded to other treatments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Dosing             | Each vial of powder contains highly purified menotrophin (human menopausal gonadotrophin, HMG) corresponding to 75 IU human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and 75 IU human luteinising hormone (LH) activity. A commonly used regimen starts at 75 to 150 IU of FSH per day and is increased if necessary by 37.5 IU (up to 75 IU), with intervals of 7 or 14 days preferably, in order to achieve an adequate but not excessive response. Maximum daily dosages of HMG Meriofert should generally not exceed 225 IU. The treatment should be adjusted to the individual patient's response, assessed by measuring the follicle size by ultrasonography and/or oestrogen levels. The daily dose is then maintained until pre-ovulatory conditions are reached. Usually, 7 to 14 days of treatment is sufficient to reach this state.                      |

| Contraindications  | Hypersensitivity to Meriofert or any component of the formulation; primary ovarian failure as indicated by a high follicle-stimulating hormone level; uncontrolled nongonadal endocrinopathies (eg, thyroid, adrenal, pituitary); pituitary or hypothalamic tumors; sex hormone-dependent tumors of the reproductive tract and accessory organs; abnormal uterine bleeding of undetermined origin; ovarian cyst or enlargement not due to polycystic ovary syndrome; pregnancy and lactation. Meriofert is contraindicated when an effective response cannot be achieved, for example, Primary ovarian failure, Malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy, and Fibroid tumors of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy.                                                                                                                     |
