Anovulatory infertility (including PCOD):In menstruating patients, treatment should be started within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. The recommended initial dose is 75-150 IU daily. The subsequent dosing should be adjusted according to individual patient response. Adjustments in dose should not be made more frequently than every 7 days. The recommended dose increment is 37.5 IU per adjustment and should not exceed 75 IU. The maximum daily dose should not be higher than 225 IU. When adequate pre-ovulatory oestrogen levels have been reached, administration of MENOPUR is stopped, and ovulation may then be induced by administering human chorionic gonadotrophin at a dose of 5000 - 10000 IU.
Women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for multiple follicular development for assisted reproductive technologies (ART):MENOPUR involved downregulation with GnRH agonists, MENOPUR therapy should start approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment. The recommended initial dose of MENOPUR is 150-225 IU daily for at least the first 5 days of treatment. Based on clinical monitoring (including ovarian ultrasound alone or in combination with measurement of oestradiol levels) subsequent dosing should be adjusted according to individual patient response, and should not exceed more than 150 IU per adjustment. The maximum daily dose given should not be higher than 450 IU daily and in most cases dosing beyond 20 days is not recommended.
