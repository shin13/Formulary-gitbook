Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment The recommended starting dose of NATESTO (testosterone) is 11.0 mg of testosterone (1 actuation per nostril) administered intranasally twice daily for a total daily dose of 22.0 mg. 
To ensure proper dosing, serum total testosterone concentrations should be measured after initiation of therapy to ensure that the desired concentrations (300 to 1050 ng/dL) are achieved. 
The NATESTO dose can be adjusted at least 30 days after starting treatment based on the serum total testosterone concentrations from a single blood draw, taken 20 minutes to 2 hours after morning administration of NATESTO. 
If the total testosterone measurement is less than 300 ng/dL, the daily testosterone dose may be increased from 22.0 mg (twice daily administration) to 33.0 mg (thrice daily administration), as instructed by a physician. Serum total testosterone concentrations should be checked periodically. 
The following rules should be applied:
1. For patients on 22.0 mg (twice daily administration): If the measured serum total testosterone concentration from the single morning blood draw is less than 300 ng/dL, the NATESTO? Product Monograph Page 15 of 39 daily dose of NATESTO may be increased from 22.0 mg (twice daily administration) to 33.0 mg (thrice daily administration); 
2. For patients on 33.0 mg (thrice daily administration): If the measured serum total testosterone concentration from the single morning blood draw is consistently less than 300 ng/dL, or if a desired clinical response is not achieved, NATESTO should be discontinued and an alternative treatment should be considered. 
If a post-dose morning total testosterone concentration consistently exceeds 1050 ng/dL, NATESTO should be discontinued.
