If the total testosterone measurement is less than 300 ng/dL, the daily testosterone dose may be increased from 22.0 mg \(twice daily administration\) to 33.0 mg \(thrice daily administration\), as instructed by a physician. Serum total testosterone concentrations should be checked periodically. The following rules should be applied: 1.
